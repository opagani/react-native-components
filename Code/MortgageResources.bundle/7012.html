A common reason to refinance a loan is to secure a lower interest rate to save money over the life of the loan. Your cost savings and breakeven point are estimated by comparing the payments associated with your current loan to the payments you would make against a new loan, taking into account any costs and fees associated with refinancing your loan. Note: your savings and breakeven point are just estimates and may be higher or lower (longer or shorter) depending on additional factors including credit score, property location, property type, loan type, and the specific lender. It does not factor in costs associated with taxes, insurance, and dues.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Current Loan Amount: </span><span class="c3">The amount of your loan initially borrowed from the lender.

Note: fees vary from lender to lender and are based on your personal information. It is important to understand the costs and fees associated with refinancing since it will help you determine whether or not you should refinance.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Roll Refinancing Costs Into New Loan: </span><span class="c3">Lenders may give borrowers the option to &quot;roll&quot; the costs and fees associated with refinancing into the new loan amount. This allows borrowers to pay off the costs over the duration of the loan instead of up front at closing. Note: the total cost of your new loan will be higher and it may take longer to break-even due to the interest incurred on the refinancing costs.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Cash Out: </span><span class="c3">Any additional cash you plan to borrow against your home's equity in excess of your current mortgage balance and loan settlement costs at the time of refinancing.

It also accounts for any costs and fees associated with refinancing your loan.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1 c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Breakeven Point: </span><span class="c3">The amount of time it will take from the start of your new loan term for your monthly cost savings associated with your new loan to cover any costs and fees associated with refinancing your current loan.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
